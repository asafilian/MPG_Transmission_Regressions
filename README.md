# MPG Transmission Regressions
We explore the relationship between a set of variables and *miles per gallon* (MPG). The dataset of interest in this report is **mtcars** from the dataset package.
We are particularly interested in the following two questions:

- ``Is an automatic or manual transmission better for MPG'' 
- ``Quantify the MPG difference between automatic and manual transmissions''

We take advantage of regression models to truely address these questions.
